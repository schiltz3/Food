### Ingredients

-   1 15oz.can black beans $0.49
-   1 cup frozen corn $0.20
-   1/2 cup red onion $0.22
-   1 clove garlic $0.08

-   10 flour tortillas (7-inch diameter) $2.00

### Instructions

-   Drain the black beans and add them to a bowl along with the frozen corn (no need to thaw)
    
-   Finely dice the onion, mince the garlic, and roughly chop the cilantro.
    
-   Add the onion, garlic, cilantro, shredded cheddar, and taco seasoning to the bowl with the beans and corn. Stir until everything is evenly combined and coated in seasoning.
    
-   Place a half cup of the filling on one side of each tortilla and fold over. Cook the quesadillas in a skillet over medium heat on each side until brown and crispy and the cheesy filling has melted. Slice into triangles then serve.
    
-   To freeze the quesadillas, stack the filled and uncooked quesadillas with a piece of parchment paper between each quesadilla. Place in a freezer bag and freeze for up to three months. To reheat either microwave (for a soft quesadilla) or cook in a skillet on low heat (make sure to use low heat so that the filling has time to thaw and melt before the outside burns).
    

### Notes

* I used my homemade taco seasoning here, but you can use a store-bought packet of taco seasoning if needed.
